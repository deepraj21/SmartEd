## Project Brief:

1. **Video Summarizer**:
   - You can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to convert the spoken content in the video into text.
   - Summarization can be done using abstractive or extractive methods depending on your requirements.
   - To make it more effective, consider extracting key points and highlights from the video.

2. **Handwritten Notes to Text**:
   - Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology can be used to convert handwritten notes into digital text.
   - You might need to preprocess the handwritten images to improve OCR accuracy.

3. **PDF Notes Summarizer**:
   - Similar to video summarization, you can apply text summarization techniques to PDF documents.
   - Consider extracting the most important information from each page or section of the PDF.

4. **Text to Flowchart Maker**:
   - This could involve natural language understanding (NLU) to parse text and extract key concepts or relationships.
   - You'll need a way to represent this information graphically as a flowchart.
